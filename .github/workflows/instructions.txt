## Adding Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support:

Once you're booted and in your desktop, run `get-apple-firmware` and choose the option **"Retrieve the firmware directly from macOS"**.

If this method doesn't work, follow [this guide](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/wifi-bluetooth/) to get firmware for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

## Adding support for Touch Bar:

If your Mac has a Touch Bar, install `tiny-dfr` by running `sudo apt update && sudo apt install tiny-dfr`
