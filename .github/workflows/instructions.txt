## How to download the ISO?

Download the "iso.sh" script in the **assets** below, run it on the terminal and follow the on screen instructions.

## Adding Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support:

In most cases, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth should work once you have installed. If not, once you're booted and are in your desktop:

- Run `get-apple-firmware get_from_macos` **if you have macOS installed as well**.
- Run `get-apple-firmware get_from_online` **if you have removed macOS or above method does not work** (Note: This method needs wired internet to work).

If these methods do not work, follow [this guide](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/wifi-bluetooth/) to get firmware for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
